# Bootstrap-Portfolio

- This folder contains numerous html files that are all linked to one css file. 
- These files are all linked via a nav bar, so once you open the inital page, you can navigate to the about me, contact, or gallery pages.
- These web pages are not yet optimized for mobile devices, or devices in which the screen size changes substantially. 
- This website was optimized for a browser in full screen on a 15" Macbook Pro. I look to correct this issue later in the class.
